Catalog
=======

is a standardized model that integrates various vendor-specific products in a domain. Since one vendor could use different terminology and format for the same product,

+ protects the actual business model from the vendor-specific variations.

+ plays a buffer between _Vendor-Specific Products_ and _Inventory_.

*Catalog* also needs a dynamic catalog management module to accommodate new vendors and new products that were not considered in advance. Thus, actual implementation of the program is done against _Catalog_ and _Inventory_. Our experience shows that developing a proper schema for _Catalog_ for a domain is most time-consuming and complex.
